# Projet_5_BLOG
Creation of a PHP blog for a school project with OpenClassrooms.

# Introduction
This is one of my projects of my apprenticeship training with OpenClassrooms to be a PHP web-developer.
The main constraint, was to not use any Framework during the developing phase.
It’s the first time I’m developing a web-site in PHP.
I tried to do as much as I could whithout using any libraries. It was important for me to understand the basic of this language and the concept of the OOP.
